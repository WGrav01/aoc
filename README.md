This is my work for the Advent of Code, written entirely in [Zig](https://ziglang.org). The current (and only) AoC year is 2025.

My rules: 
- No AI usage, whatsoever
- Optimize the hell out of it
- Learn something from it

Thanks to Sh4d1 for making the helper library, [aozig](https://github.com/Sh4d1/aozig/).
